/*
   We will represent the general immediate reward structure as a
linked list, where each node of the list will correspond to a single
R: * : ... entry.  The entry from the file could specify a single
value, a row of values, or an entire matrix.  Thus we need three
different representations depending on the situation.  Additionally,
all of the components could have a wildcard character indicating
that it is a specification for a family of values.  This is indicated
with special characters.

*/

/* Each of the action, states and obs could have a state index number,
  or one of these two values.  Since states cannot be negative we use
  negative values for the special characters.  The observation cannot
  be present when the next_state is present, but this should be
  enforced by the parser.  When both the next state and obs are not
  present, we will use a sparse matrix representation.  When only the
  obs is not present we will use a single dimensional, non-sparse
  matrix.  When both are specified we use a single value.  Note that
  it does not matter if the indivdual elements are specific indices or
  a wildcard, either way we will store a single value.
